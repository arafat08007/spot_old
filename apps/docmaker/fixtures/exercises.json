            "question": "An earthbound sibling observers her twin to depart from earth at a \nspeed 60% the speed of light. After 10.0 years, the travelling twin \nreturns having travelled 3.0 light-years and back. (a) Calculate the \nproper time the travelling twin was aboard the spaceship. (b) From the \ntraveler's vantage point, the earth-bound twin's clocks tick slow. How \nmuch time does she observe to pass on earth? (c) During the moment of \nacceleration 3.0 light-years out, the clocks aboard ship go out of \nsynch with those on earth. Calculate how far ahead the \ndesynchronization put the clocks on the ship.", 
            "solution": "\\(a) The gamma factor for the travelling twin is\n\n.. math::\n\n    \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.60)^2}} = 1.25\n    \nThe proper time of the travelling twin is\n\n.. math::\n\n    (10) = (1.25) \\Delta \\tau \\implies \\tau = 8.0\n    \nAs the earth-bound twin watches, only 8.0 years pass on the ship.\n\n\\(b) From the *traveler's* point of view it is the earth that is moving \naway with a speed of :math:`0.60c`. The gamma factor is also 1.25. \nSince the travelling twin is measuring events on earth, her clocks are \nnot measuring proper time on earth. Using the time dilation formula, \nthe proper time is\n\n.. math::\n\n    (8) = (1.25) \\Delta \\tau \\implies \\tau = 6.4\n    \nIn other words, as the travelling twin watches, only 6.4 years pass on \nearth.\n\n\\(c) When the traveller returns either 6.4 years or 10.0 years have \npassed. Which is it? The truth is that the trip has two legs with a \nbrief period of acceleration in the middle. As the question points out, \nthis acceleration must cover the gap by introducing 3.6 years of \npercieved time for the traveller. This is the desynchronization effect. \nWe can calculate the amount that the clocks on earth appear to shift as:\n\n.. math::\n\n    \\Delta t = \\frac{Lv}{c^2} = \\frac{(3.0c)(0.60c)}{c^2} = 1.8\n    \nNotice the shortcut that :math:`L = 3.0c`. This works because 3.0 \nlight-years is the distance light travels in 3.0 years. Since \n:math:`x = vt`, the distance is :math:`L = (c)(3.0)`.\n\nThis is the amount of desynchronization introduced by going from rest \nto a speed of :math:`0.60c`. But we are slowing down to rest then \naccelerating in the other direction up to the same speed so the time \nshift is double: 3.6 yr.",
