There is something deep in the human psyche that resists the idea of any kind of influence that acts \"at-a-distance\".  \r\n\r\n* This resistance manifests itself in many ways: \"nature abhors a vacuum\" (which goes back to Aristotle), Descartes filled the solar system with \"fluid\" to describe the motion of the planets. We also have \"animal magnetism\" and telekinetics. \r\n\r\n* In modern physics we still have the differential form of physical equations and local conservation laws. \r\n\r\n* There are three basic long-range forces for us to consider: magnetism, gravity, and electricity. \r\n\r\n* We now know that magnetism (the first to be studied as such) is a relativistic manifestation of electricity. This realization comes late in our story in the 1800s with Faraday and Maxwell. Inspired by this, Einstein reworked Newton's theory of gravity. \r\n\r\n* Both electromagnetism and general relativity are based on the idea of the :jargon:`force field` introduced by Faraday. \r\n\r\n* The field allows us to have our cake and eat it too. The force field acts as the intermediate agent between the source of force (an electric charge or gravitational mass) and the object influenced. \r\n\r\n* One unforeseen result of this field idea was that these investigations of electromagnetism were unshackled from classical concepts. In this way Maxwell's equations uncovered the weaknesses of Newtonian mechanics and lead to relativity.",

In principle, we already know the answers: :math:`E = kQq/r^2` and :math:`F = qE`. But as we progress, we will tweak these answers---right now they only work for the special case of charges at rest. \r\n\r\n* When Faraday first introduced the idea of the electric and magnetic fields, he was thinking in terms of :jargon:`field lines`. These are mathematically very similar the streamlines we talked about when studying fluid flow. (They may be conceptually similar also: in quantum field theory, the EM field is modeled as a flood of quantum photons.) \r\n\r\n* Each electric charges is either a source or sink of these electric field lines: positive charges are sources and negative charges are sinks. The field lines radiate from these charges and distribute themselves evenly throughout space. The density of the field lines represent the magnitude of the electric field at that point. \r\n\r\n* We call the :jargon:`electric flux` is the \"number\" of field lines running through any given surface.

We experience gravity every day we try and get out of bed. Why then is the electric force only manifest in dramatic bursts of energy like lightning or parlor tricks of static electricity? \r\n\r\n* The short answer is that most things are electrically neutral. No electric charge, no electric force.\r\n\r\n* But there is more to this story. All three building blocks of matter (two quarks and the electron) are electrically charged. But because there are *two* types of charge, they combine together in an electrically balanced atom. \r\n\r\n* In a way, the electric force is shackled with its own strength: these charged particles lock together and shield the rest of the universe from the electric charges running around inside.

On the other side are :jargon:`insulators` which strongly resist the flow of electric charge. We can use conductors to transport charge and insulators to hold it. \r\n\r\n* Since charge flows easily in a conductor, any excess charge will be pushed to the surface and spread evenly througout. If we take another conductor and touch a charged one, the excess charge will spread to it also. In this way we can \"pick up\" the charge and move it.\r\n\r\n* There is a trickier way to \"induce\" charge in a conductor. Suppose we place a positively charged object close to a neutral conductor. This will pull the negative charge close and push the postive charge away. If we allow the postive charge to drain away, the conductor is left with a net negative charge.\r\n\r\n* One important configuration to consider is the :jargon:`capacitor`, which is simply two parallel conductive plates separated by an insulator. A capacitor \"traps\" electric charge: one plate with positive charge and the other with negative charge. These two sets of charge will attract, but the insulator keeps them apart.\r\n\r\n* The charge on each plate distributes itself: we end up with a consistent charge per unit area (symbol = :math:`\\sigma`).

This is because the plates attract the bound opposite charges in the insulator effectively decreasing the distance :math:`d`. The factor of improvement for the insulating material is called its :jargon:`dielectric constant` (symbol = :math:`\\kappa`). \r\n\r\n* On the other hand, we have ignored the \"edge effects\" which will be significant for any real capacitor. The SI unit for capacitance is the :jargon:`farad`. Typical values for capacitors are microfarads (:sci:`1E-6`) and picofarads (:sci:`1E-9`). \r\n\r\n* The amount of potential energy created when charging a capacitor is \r\n\r\n  .. math::\r\n\r\n      PE = \\half CV^2 \r\n      \r\n* This follows from the formula for potential energy :math:`qV` and the definition of capacitance :math:`Q = CV`. The factor of one-half is there because the potential energy builds up with each incremental charge. The voltage is not constant rather it increases throughout. \r\n\r\n* One nice thing about the capacitor is that on the inside the electric field is constant. This gives us an easy situation to analyze the electric field. \r\n\r\n* For example, consider a vacuum filled capacitor without any insulator.

Technically, we will be solving the time-independent\r\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation: \r\n\r\n.. math::\r\n    :name: sch-eqn\r\n    \r\n    \\tag{1}\r\n    -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} \\psi = (E - V) \\psi\r\n\r\nWe will walk through what you need to know for this project in this\r\nfirst section. \r\n\r\n\r\nFirst case: :math:`E` greater than :math:`V`\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are two important cases to consider when discussing Equation\r\n:eqn:`sch-eqn`. The first is when :math:`E > V`. This means that the\r\ntotal energy of the particle is greater than its potential energy. The\r\nremainder is its kinetic energy. Although we could replace :math:`E -\r\nV` with a symbol for kinetic energy, it is typical not to. You will\r\nsee why when we discuss the second case below. \r\n\r\nThe general solution of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation :eqn:`sch-eqn`\r\nin this first case is \r\n\r\n.. math::\r\n    :name: sch-soln-cos\r\n    \r\n    \\tag{2}\r\n    \\psi(x) = A \\cos (kx + \\phi)\r\n\r\nThe value of :math:`k` is directly related to the energy of the\r\nparticle:\r\n\r\n.. math::\r\n    :name: prop-real\r\n    \r\n    \\tag{3}\r\n    \\hbar k = \\sqrt{2m(E - V)}\r\n    \r\n.. admonition:: Exercise\r\n\r\n    Calculate the :math:`k` value of an electron with an energy of\r\n    one electron-volt. Assume the electron is free from any force\r\n    potential (:math:`V` = 0).\r\n\r\nThis :math:`k`-value is actually the reciprocal of the de~Broglie\r\nwavelength of the particle. It is sometimes called the \"propagation\r\nvector\". \r\n\r\n.. admonition:: Exercise\r\n\r\n    Derive Equation :eqn:`prop-real` from the de~Broglie\r\n    wavelength formula :math:`\\lambda = h/p`. You will need to use the\r\n    (non-relativistic) definitions of momentum and kinetic energy\r\n    and the relationship :math:`k = 1/\\lambda`.} \r\n\r\nWhat about :math:`A` and :math:`\\phi`? These are determined by the\r\nnature of the potential and any boundary conditions we have in our\r\nparticular problem. The bulk of this project will be in determining\r\ntheir proper value. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecond case: :math:`E` less than :math:`V`\r\n------------------------------------------        \r\n\r\nThe second case to deal with in solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\r\nis when :math:`E < V`. This is relevant because we are discussing\r\na particle \"trapped\" in a potential well. There must be some\r\n:math:`x`-values where total energy is under the potential. \r\n\r\nBut this implies that the kinetic energy is negative. In a classical\r\nworld, the particle is never in this region since :math:`KE = \\half\r\nmv^2` which cannot be smaller than zero. But in the quantum world\r\nthere is a non-zero solution to Equation :eqn:`sch-eqn` given by\r\n\r\n.. math::\r\n    :name: sch-soln-exp\r\n    \r\n    \\tag{4}\r\n    \\psi(x) = A \\exp(\\kappa x + \\phi) \r\n    \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \r\n    \\psi(x) = A \\exp(-\\kappa x + \\phi)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n.. math::\r\n    :name: prop-imag\r\n    \r\n    \\tag{5}\r\n    \\hbar \\kappa = \\sqrt{2m(V - E)}\r\n\r\nLike before, the :math:`A` and :math:`\\phi` are determined by\r\nboundary conditions. Notice that the solution is either one of these\r\nequations---never both. [1]_ The choice is usually obvious since we\r\nwant to pick the one that produces exponential decay as the :math:`x`\r\ngets large rather than exponential growth. \r\n\r\n.. [1] I'm not 100% sure of this statement, but I can't recall a\r\n   solution in my studies that used both at the same time. It will\r\n   certainly be true in *this* project. \r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThat is all you will need to know about solving the Schr\u00f6dinger\r\nequation for this project. The basic rule is that the solution is a\r\nsimple cosine wave when the kinetic energy is positive. The wavelength\r\nis related to this kinetic energy via the de~Broglie wavelength in\r\nEquation :eqn:`prop-real`. In the region where the potential energy\r\nexceeds the total energy of the particle (the \"forbidden region\"),\r\nthe wave exponentially decays away. \r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nSetting up the Spreadsheet\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe potential energy function :math:`V` in which we are interested is\r\ndefined by the blue line in Figure :fig:`qm-pot`. \r\n\r\n.. fig:: The potential well for our particle\r\n    :label: qm-pot\r\n\r\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}%[xscale=0.5]\r\n    \\fill [blue!10] (-4,0) -- (-4,2) -- (-2,2) -- (-2,0) (4,0) \r\n    -- (4,2) -- (2,2) -- (2,0);\r\n    \\draw (-4.2,0) -- (4.2,0);\r\n    \\foreach \\x in {-4,...,4} { \\draw (\\x,0.1) -- (\\x,-0.1) \r\n    node [below=1mm] {\\x}; }\r\n    \\draw (0,2.2) -- (0,-0.2);\r\n    \\foreach \\y in {1,2} \r\n    { \r\n    \\draw (0.1,\\y) -- (-0.1,\\y) node [left] {\\y}; \r\n    }\r\n    \\draw [blue] (-4,2) -- (-2,2) -- (-2,0) -- (2,0) \r\n    -- (2,2) -- (4,2);\r\n    \\draw [red] (-4.2,1) -- (4.2,1);\r\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\r\n\r\nSince we are going to discuss a particle that is \"trapped\" in this\r\npotential, we should consider the energy of the particle to be less\r\nthan two. For the sake of argument, let's assume the energy value\r\nis one. (We will change this later.) This is represented in Figure\r\n:fig:`qm-pot` by the red line. \r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nLet's start building our spreadsheet to represent this potential. I've\r\nchosen to use OpenOffice.org Calc for this project. This open\r\nsource software works very similar to Microsoft Excel. There\r\nare many ways to get the program if you choose to use it. Go to\r\nhttp://www.openoffice.org for more information. [2]_ Although some of\r\nthe details will be different, you can use Excel if you prefer. \r\n\r\n.. [2] You can even get a completely portable version to install\r\n   and carry around on your flash drive. See\r\n   http://portableapps.com/apps/office/openoffice_portable.\r\n\r\nSince the screen real estate on my little netbook is limited,\r\nI have eliminated all the toolbars and will be using the menus\r\nin this walk-through. Figure :fig:`p203p1_01.png` shows the ``About``\r\npage from the ``Help`` menu. \r\n\r\n.. fig:: OpenOffice.org Calc\r\n    :image: p203p1_01.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nTo begin, type the data from Table :tbl:`input01` into the appropriate\r\ncells. \r\n\r\n.. tbl:: The control panel\r\n    :label: input01\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    ======  ========     \r\n    ``A1``  ``hbar``\r\n    ``A2``  ``m``\r\n    ``A3``  ``E``\r\n    ``B1``  ``1``\r\n    ``B2``  ``1``\r\n    ``B3``  ``1``\r\n    ======  ========     \r\n\r\nWe will use the first few rows as a kind of \"control panel\" for our\r\ndocument. Notice that we have set ``hbar`` (symbol: :math:`\\hbar`)\r\nto be equal to one. This is a common practice among physicsists and\r\nmeans that we are no longer working in SI units. We could put the\r\nstandard value in here, but the numbers get a bit unruly (a mere\r\nannoyance, but annoying nonetheless). We could also put the mass\r\nof the electron in for :math:`m`, but let's keep it simple. This\r\nimplies that the :math:`E` we are using is some non-standard unit as\r\nwell. But since we are really interested in the relative differences,\r\nthis will be good enough. \r\n\r\nOkay---enough excuses. Let's go ahead and build our potential\r\nfunction. The first step is to input the data from Table\r\n:tbl:`input02`. \r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Potential function: left side\r\n    :label: input02\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    ======  ================================\r\n    ``A8``  ``x1``\r\n    ``B8``  ``V1``\r\n    ``C8``  ``k1``\r\n    ``D8``  ``wf1``\r\n    ``A9``  ``-10``\r\n    ``B9``  ``2``\r\n    ``C9``  ``=SQRT(2*$B$2*(B9-$B$3))/$B$1``\r\n    ``D9``  ``=EXP(C9*A9)``\r\n    ======  ================================\r\n\r\nWhen you are done, your screen should look something like Figure\r\n:fig:`p203p1_02.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Initial setup\r\n    :image: p203p1_02.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35 \r\n\r\nThe first column is our horizontal distance on the graph and the\r\nsecond column is the potential energy at that point. The reason for\r\nthe \"1\" suffix is that we will split this problem into three parts: \r\n\r\n* The left side with :math:`V` = 2,\r\n* The center with :math:`V` = 0, and\r\n* The right side with :math:`V` = 2 again.\r\n\r\nThe third column represents our :math:`k` value and corresponds\r\nto equation :eqn:`prop-imag`. The fourth column holds our\r\nwavefunction---see equation :eqn:`sch-soln-exp`. \r\n\r\n.. admonition:: Exercise\r\n\r\n    Explain why we choose the :math:`\\exp(\\kappa x)` form for the\r\n    left side of the wave function. Be sure to discuss the choice\r\n    of the sign in front of :math:`\\kappa`. \r\n\r\nNow we need to push these calculations to :math:`x` = -5. Enter the\r\nfollowing from Table :tbl:`input03`.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Building up the left side\r\n    :label: input03\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  =================================\r\n    ``A10``  ``=A9+0.5``\r\n    ``B10``  ``=B9``\r\n    ``C10``  ``=SQRT(2*$B$2*(B10-$B$3))/$B$1``\r\n    ``D10``  ``=EXP(C10*A10)``\r\n    =======  =================================\r\n\r\nNow drag these cells down to row ``19``. Do this by selecting the range \r\n``A10:D19`` and type ``Ctrl-D``. Your screen should now look like \r\nFigure :fig:`p203p1_03.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Left side built\r\n    :image: p203p1_03.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nYou may not be showing as many decimals as I am. One simple way\r\nto match my picture is to click on the small box to the left of\r\ncolumn ``A`` and above ``1`` which will highlight all the cells\r\nin the sheet. Now go to the menu item ``Format >> Cells...``.\r\nClick on the ``Numbers`` tab in the pop-up window. Click ``Number``\r\nin the ``Category`` selection box and ``-1234.1235`` in the ``Format``\r\nselection box. The ``Format code`` on the bottom should read ``0.0000``\r\n(see Figure :fig:`p203p1_03b.png`. Click ``OK`` and you should be set.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Changing the number format\r\n    :image: p203p1_03b.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nNow might be a good time to save the spreadsheet (if you haven't\r\ndone so already). Notice that OpenOffice Calc will automatically save\r\nthe document in Open Document Format (extention ``.ods``). Microsoft\r\nExcel might refuse to read this format, so I suggest you would save\r\nthe document in an Excel format by changing the file type to ``.xls``\r\nwhen you type in your filename.\r\n\r\nWe now need to build the center and right sides of our potential\r\nwell. Enter the data from Table :tbl:`input04`.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Building up the center\r\n    :label: input04\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  =================================\r\n    ``A22``  ``x2``\r\n    ``B22``  ``V2``\r\n    ``C22``  ``k2``\r\n    ``D22``  ``wf2``\r\n    ``A23``  ``-5``\r\n    ``B23``  ``0``\r\n    ``C23``  ``=SQRT(2*$B$2*($B$3-B23))/$B$1``\r\n    ``D23``  ``=COS(C23*A23)``\r\n    ``A24``  ``=A23+0.5``\r\n    ``B24``  ``=B23``\r\n    ``C24``  ``=SQRT(2*$B$2*($B$3-B24))/$B$1``\r\n    ``D24``  ``=COS(C24*A24)``\r\n    =======  =================================\r\n\r\nNote the differences in the formulas for columns ``C`` and ``D``. Now\r\ndrag the cell in row ``24`` down to row ``43`` by highlighting cells\r\n``A24:D43`` and typing ``Ctrl-D``. Your screen should look like Figure\r\n:fig:`p203p1_04.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Center built\r\n    :image: p203p1_04.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nNow the same story for the right side. Enter the data from Table\r\n:tbl:`input05` and drag these cells down to row ``57``. Your screen\r\nshould look like Figure :fig:`p203p1_05.png`.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Building up the right side\r\n    :label: input05\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  =================================\r\n    ``A46``  ``x2``\r\n    ``B46``  ``V2``\r\n    ``C46``  ``k2``\r\n    ``D46``  ``wf2``\r\n    ``A47``  ``-5``\r\n    ``B47``  ``0``\r\n    ``C47``  ``=SQRT(2*$B$2*(B47-$B$3))/$B$1``\r\n    ``D47``  ``=EXP(-C47*A47)``\r\n    ``A48``  ``=A47+0.5``\r\n    ``B48``  ``=B47``\r\n    ``C48``  ``=SQRT(2*$B$2*(B48-$B$3))/$B$1``\r\n    ``D48``  ``=EXP(-C48*A48)``\r\n    =======  =================================\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Left side built\r\n    :image: p203p1_05.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\n\r\nTailoring the Spreadsheet\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nWe know have the backbone of the spreadsheet built and we are\r\nabout half done with the setup. However, there is a problem in\r\nwhat we have done so far. The wavefunction in column ``D`` is not\r\ncontinuous---it's a broken string. Notice how the functions do not\r\ntouch at the interfaces when :math:`x` = -5 or :math:`x` =5. We\r\nneed to \"tie\" these three functions together in such a way that the\r\nwhole curve is smooth and connected.\r\n\r\nType the information [3]_ from Table :tbl:`input06` and drag cell\r\n``E9`` down to row ``19``, cell ``E23`` to row ``43``, and cell\r\n``E47`` to row ``57``.\r\n\r\n.. [3] Psi is the greek letter :math:`\\psi` which is traditionally\r\n   used to symbolize the wave function.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Copying the wave function\r\n    :label: input06\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  ==============\r\n    ``E7``   ``1``\r\n    ``E8``   ``psi1``\r\n    ``E9``   ``=$E$7*D9``\r\n    ``E21``  ``1``\r\n    ``E22``  ``psi2``\r\n    ``E23``  ``=$E$21*D23``\r\n    ``E45``  ``1``\r\n    ``E46``  ``psi3``\r\n    ``E47``  ``=$E$45*D47``\r\n    =======  ==============\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like we have done anything---we've simply copied\r\nour wave function into column ``E``. But this is how we are going to\r\n\"stitch\" the functions together.  Type the information from Table\r\n:tbl:`input07`. After that, your screen should look like Figure\r\n:fig:`p203p1_06.png`.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Stitching up the functions\r\n    :label: input07\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  ============\r\n    ``E7``   ``=D23/D19``\r\n    ``E45``  ``=D43/D47``\r\n    =======  ============\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Functions are now \"stitched\" together\r\n    :image: p203p1_06.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the numbers in cells ``E19`` and ``E23``\r\nare the same. The same should be true of cells ``E43`` and ``E47``. It\r\nis now time to build a chart to see what we are working with.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharting The Wave Function\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter saving your work (you have been saving regularly, haven't you?),\r\nmove your cursor up to cell ``N1``. Now go to the menu and click\r\n``Insert >> Chart...``.\r\n\r\nA new window should pop up. In step 1, choose the chart type labeled\r\n``XY (Scatter)``, click on the ``Lines Only`` picture, and the check\r\nbox ``Smooth lines``.  See Figure :fig:`p203p1_08.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Choosing a chart\r\n    :image: p203p1_08.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nClick ``Next >>``. Skip step 2 by clicking on ``Next >>`` again. Now\r\nclick the ``Add`` button. You should see something like Figure\r\n:fig:`p203p1_09.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Adding data series\r\n    :image: p203p1_09.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nClick on ``Name`` in the ``Data ranges`` selection box and type\r\n``psi1`` in the ``Range for Name`` input box. Then click on\r\n``X-Values`` in the ``Data ranges`` selection box and click on the\r\nbutton on the far right next to the ``Range for X-Values``. The pop-up\r\nbox disappears temporarily and will now allow you to select a range\r\non your spreadsheet. Highlight the cells ``A9:A19``. The pop-up box\r\nwill reappear and now reads ``$Sheet1.$A$9:$A$19`` in the ``Range for\r\nX-Values`` box. You can also simply type this in directly. Now click\r\non the ``Y-Values`` in the ``Data ranges` selection box. Highlight\r\ncells ``E9:E19``. The left side of the wave function is now linked\r\nto the chart.\r\n\r\nRepeat this procedure for the center of the wave functions. Do this\r\nby clicking ``Add`` under the ``Data series`` selection box. A new\r\n``Unnamed Series`` should appear.  Type ``psi2`` as the name and link\r\nthe ``X-Values` to cells ``A23:A43`` and the ``Y-Values`` to cells\r\n``E23:E43``.\r\n\r\nDo this again for the right side. Name it ``psi3`` and link it to\r\ncells ``A47:A57`` and ``E47:E57``. After all this, click ``Finish``\r\nand scroll to the top to see your chart. Click anywhere off of\r\nthe chart to get out of \"charting mode.\" You might want to zoom\r\nout a bit to see it all on one screen. (Do this under menu item\r\n``View >> Zoom...``.) Hopefully it looks something like Figure\r\n:fig:`p203p1_10.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Spreadsheet with chart\r\n    :image: p203p1_10.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nThese defaults are nice, but we are going to change some to show\r\noff our curve a bit more. Click on the chart (this puts you in\r\nsomething like an \"object mode\"). Then double-click on the chart\r\n(this puts you in something like a \"chart mode\"). Right click and a\r\nsmall contextual menu pops up. You could click on ``Data Ranges...``}\r\nto correct any errors you may have made while linking the chart.\r\n\r\nBut now I want to make three adjustments. First: get rid of the\r\nlegend. Right click on it and click ``Cut``. Or left-click and hit\r\nthe ``Del`` key.\r\n\r\nSecond thing is to do is to change the :math:`x`-axis. Double-click\r\non one of the numbers.  A pop-up box will appear. Go to the ``Scale``\r\ntab and de-select the ``Minimum``, ``Maximum``, and ``Major Interval``\r\ncheck boxes labeled ``Automatic``.  Change the numbers to -10, 10,\r\nand 5, respectively. Now go to the ``Numbers`` tab.  De-select the\r\n``Source Format`` check box and change the ``Format Code`` to just\r\na zero (``0``). This will suppress all of the unnecessary decimals\r\nin the chart.  Click ``OK``.\r\n\r\nFinally double-click on one of the :math:`y`-axis numbers and change\r\nits ``Format Code`` (on the ``Numbers`` tab) to zero also. Click\r\nanywhere off the chart to get out of charting mode. Your chart is\r\nnow ready. Check it against Figure :fig:`p203p1_11.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Spreadsheet with adjusted chart\r\n    :image: p203p1_11.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nNow not only do we have a nice looking chart of our wave function,\r\nbut we also have the classically \"forbidden\" areas highlighted in\r\na different color.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother complication\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nYou might think we are now done. We have nice looking wave function\r\nfor our particle with energy :math:`E` = 1 trapped in a potential\r\n:math:`V` = 2 units high. And we do. But observe what happens when\r\nwe change the energy value to, say, :math:`E` = 0.5. Do this by\r\nchanging cell ``B3`` to ``0.5``. Your spreadsheet will look like\r\nFigure :fig:`p203p1_12.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Changing the energy to 0.5 units\r\n    :image: p203p1_12.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the wave cannot have a spike like it does\r\nat :math:`x` = -5 and :math:`x` = 5. The function must be both\r\ncontinuous and smooth. At the interface the functions must not only\r\nhave the same value, but they must also have the same slope.\r\n\r\nTo explain why, imagine this were a physical string. The spike in\r\nthe curve is indicating that this energy level creates a reflected\r\nwave that is destructively out-of-phase with the original. The\r\nreflected wave destroys rather than resonates into a standing wave.\r\nIn other words, this partiular energy level cannot support a standing\r\nwave. Remember de Broglie's explanation of the Bohr atom? Only certain\r\nenergy levels can produce standing waves. The same is true here.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean that our spreadsheet is broken? On the contrary,\r\nit is doing precisely what it should. It is telling us that this\r\nis an invalid energy level for our trapped particle.  We must\r\nlook for another energy level. We will know when we find one when\r\nthe slopes at the boundaries match. Try :math:`E` = 0.4. This is\r\nmuch closer to a valid energy level. Is there a way to measure how\r\nclose we are? I'm glad you asked. Type the information from Table\r\n:tbl:`input08` into the spreadsheet and drag the formulas down to\r\nfill in the rest of the table. Your document should look something\r\nlike Figure :fig:`p203p1_13.png`.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Preparing to measure the slopes\r\n    :label: input08\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  ===============================\r\n    ``D1``   ``nudge``\r\n    ``E1``   ``1e-9``\r\n    ``F8``   ``npsi1``\r\n    ``F9``   ``=$E$7*EXP(C9*(A9+$E$1))``\r\n    ``G8``   ``m1``\r\n    ``G9``   ``=(F9-E9)/$E$1``\r\n    ``F22``  ``npsi2``\r\n    ``F23``  ``=$E$21*COS(C23*(A23+$E$1))``\r\n    ``G22``  ``m2``\r\n    ``G23``  ``=(F23-E23)/$E$1``\r\n    ``F46``  ``npsi3``\r\n    ``F47``  ``=$E$45*EXP(-C47*(A47+$E$1))``\r\n    ``G46``  ``m3``\r\n    ``G47``  ``=(F47-E47)/$E$1``\r\n    =======  ===============================\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Adding the slopes to the spreadsheet\r\n    :image: p203p1_13.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nWhat have we done here? Remember that we want to be able to compare\r\nthe slopes of the three curves at their interfaces. This is what is\r\nin column ``G``. It is the basic rise-over-run formula. But instead\r\nof measuring the rise and run from point to point in the rows we have\r\nalready calculated, we are measuring the rise over a *very small*\r\nrun. That is what the \"nudge\" value is in cell ``E1`` (notice how it\r\nis the denominator in the slope calculation). The values in column\r\n``F`` are the wavefunction evaluated at :math:`x` plus this small\r\nnudge factor (hence \"npsi\" or the nudged psi value). The difference\r\nbetween columns ``F`` and ``E`` is the rise of our slope.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line here is that we want cells ``G19`` and ``G23`` to match\r\njust like we wanted cells ``E19`` and ``E23`` to match. Similarly\r\nwe want ``G43`` and ``G47`` to match. Unfortunately there is no\r\nsimple algebraic way to stitch these together like we did in column\r\n``E``. We just have to hunt for a solution.\r\n\r\nBut just because we are hunting doesn't mean we can't be\r\nefficient. Type the following from Table :tbl:`input09`\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Checking the slope match\r\n    :label: input09\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    ======  =================\r\n    ``G1``  ``dm12``\r\n    ``H1``  ``=ABS(G19-G23)``\r\n    ``G2``  ``dm23``\r\n    ``H2``  ``=ABS(G43-G47)``\r\n    ``G3``  ``sbz``\r\n    ``H3``  ``=SUM(H1:H2)``\r\n    ======  =================\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a quick table indicating how far off our\r\nslopes are from matching.  Cell ``H1`` is comparing the slopes at\r\n:math:`x` = -5 and cell ``H2`` is comparing the slopes at :math:`x`\r\n= 5. Both of these should be zero. Cell ``H3`` simply sums these two\r\nin order to get a single measure for us to track. The label ``sbz``\r\nstands for \"should be zero.\" Your spreadsheet should look like Figure\r\n:fig:`p203p1_14.png`. This spreadsheet is now pretty much ready to use.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Slope double-checks are in place\r\n    :image: p203p1_14.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nIn order to find our standing wave patterns all we need to do is tweak\r\nthe energy level in cell ``B3`` until cell ``H3`` goes to zero. For\r\nexample, :math:`E` = 0.36 is the best fit with two decimals. :math:`E`\r\n= 0.365 is the best fit with three decimals.\r\n\r\n.. admonition:: Exercise\r\n\r\n    What is the best fit near :math:`E` = 0.365 to four decimals?\r\n    \r\n    ..

What is its energy out to four decimals?\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nFind the Energy Levels\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nEfficient Hunting: Goal Seek\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nI have one more trick up my sleeve. Change the energy level to 0.01\r\nunits. Now go to the menu and click on ``Tools >> Goal Seek...``. Type\r\nin ``H3`` for the ``Formula cell``, type ``0.001`` for the ``Target\r\nvalue``, and type ``B3`` for the ``Variable cell``. The pop-up window\r\nshould look like Figure :fig:`p203p1_15.png`.\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Goal seeking\r\n    :image: p203p1_15.png\r\n    :scale: 0.35\r\n\r\nClick ``OK``. A new pop-up window should read ``Goal Seek successful.``\r\n``Insert result (0.0408) into current cell?`` Click ``Yes.`` The\r\nprogram just found your first energy level. The goal seek is designed\r\nto drive the formula cell to the value you specify by changing\r\nthe variable cell. This is exactly what we need to find our energy\r\nlevels. Note that you must be fairly close to the goal in order for\r\nthis to work.  But if you can get close, the program will do the rest.\r\n\r\nLet's try :math:`E` = 1 again. Type ``1`` into cell ``B3`` and goal\r\nseek it. You will find that the actual answer is not exactly one.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. admonition:: Exercise\r\n\r\n    Find all the energy levels to four digit accuracy. There are four\r\n    total. Print out the standing wave pattern for each of them. Go\r\n    ahead and record these energy levels somewhere (I've left room\r\n    in row ``5``) so you don't have to hunt for them again.}\r\n\r\n.. fig:: Cosine wave patterns\r\n    :label: eig-cos\r\n

Half\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThis is pretty slick, but one problem remains. We are only finding\r\nhalf of the possible energy levels. The patterns you should have so\r\nfar are in Figure :fig:`eig-cos`.\r\n\r\nYou won't have the dashed lines, but they are there to remind you\r\nthat this standing wave pattern oscillates---just like a string. So\r\nthe antinodes oscillate between the maximum peaks and minimum\r\ntroughs. Look at the four wave patterns we have found. The number\r\nof antinodes is always odd. There are more standing waves with an\r\neven number of antinodes that we have yet to find.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and save the workbook. Then go to the menu ``File >> Save\r\nAs``. Save a copy of your document with a slightly different name. We\r\nare going to make one last adjustment.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to work in your copied workbook, make the changes\r\nlisted in Table :tbl:`input10` and drag them down to row ``43``.\r\n\r\n.. tbl:: Changing the central cosine to sine\r\n    :label: input10\r\n    :cols: |c|l|\r\n\r\n    =======  ==============================\r\n    ``D23``  ``=SIN(C23*A23)``\r\n    ``F23``  ``=$E$21*SIN(C23*(A23+$E$1))``\r\n    =======  ==============================\r\n\r\n.. admonition:: Exercise\r\n\r\n    Equation :eqn:`sch-soln-cos` is the solution for the wave function\r\n    in the central region.

It will be\r\nset up to launch vertically using superballs. Set up the photogate\r\nso that it measures the velocity of the ball just as it leaves the\r\nlauncher (see Figure :fig:`lab-01-001`). Measure the diameter of\r\nthe ball and input this length into the computer. \r\n\r\nPay careful attention to how the center of the ball is aligned with\r\nthe photogate. The full diameter of the ball must block the light\r\npath. This is because the photogate actually measures the length\r\nof time the beam is blocked. It calculates the velocity by dividing\r\nthis duration into the input length.

Start with a shallow angle (less than 45\u00b0). Place a piece\r\nof paper over the carbon paper to measure the average range of the\r\nballistic launcher.

(c) During the moment of \nacceleration 3.0 light-years out, the clocks aboard ship go out of \nsynch with those on earth.

            "solution": "\\(a) The gamma factor for the travelling twin is\n\n.. math::\n\n    \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.60)^2}} = 1.25\n    \nThe proper time of the travelling twin is\n\n.. math::\n\n    (10) = (1.25) \\Delta \\tau \\implies \\tau = 8.0\n    \nAs the earth-bound twin watches, only 8.0 years pass on the ship.\n\n\\(b) From the *traveler's* point of view it is the earth that is moving \naway with a speed of :math:`0.60c`. The gamma factor is also 1.25. \nSince the travelling twin is measuring events on earth, her clocks are \nnot measuring proper time on earth.

Which is it? The truth is that the trip has two legs with a \nbrief period of acceleration in the middle. As the question points out, \nthis acceleration must cover the gap by introducing 3.6 years of \npercieved time for the traveller. This is the desynchronization effect. \nWe can calculate the amount that the clocks on earth appear to shift as:\n\n.. math::\n\n    \\Delta t = \\frac{Lv}{c^2} = \\frac{(3.0c)(0.60c)}{c^2} = 1.8\n    \nNotice the shortcut that :math:`L = 3.0c`. This works because 3.0 \nlight-years is the distance light travels in 3.0 years. Since \n:math:`x = vt`, the distance is :math:`L = (c)(3.0)`.\n\nThis is the amount of desynchronization introduced by going from rest \nto a speed of :math:`0.60c`.
