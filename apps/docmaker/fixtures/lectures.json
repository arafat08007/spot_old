There is something deep in the human psyche that resists the idea of any kind of influence that acts \"at-a-distance\".  \r\n\r\n* This resistance manifests itself in many ways: \"nature abhors a vacuum\" (which goes back to Aristotle), Descartes filled the solar system with \"fluid\" to describe the motion of the planets. We also have \"animal magnetism\" and telekinetics. \r\n\r\n* In modern physics we still have the differential form of physical equations and local conservation laws. \r\n\r\n* There are three basic long-range forces for us to consider: magnetism, gravity, and electricity. \r\n\r\n* We now know that magnetism (the first to be studied as such) is a relativistic manifestation of electricity. This realization comes late in our story in the 1800s with Faraday and Maxwell. Inspired by this, Einstein reworked Newton's theory of gravity. \r\n\r\n* Both electromagnetism and general relativity are based on the idea of the :jargon:`force field` introduced by Faraday. \r\n\r\n* The field allows us to have our cake and eat it too. The force field acts as the intermediate agent between the source of force (an electric charge or gravitational mass) and the object influenced. \r\n\r\n* One unforeseen result of this field idea was that these investigations of electromagnetism were unshackled from classical concepts. In this way Maxwell's equations uncovered the weaknesses of Newtonian mechanics and lead to relativity."

In principle, we already know the answers: :math:`E = kQq/r^2` and :math:`F = qE`. But as we progress, we will tweak these answers---right now they only work for the special case of charges at rest. \r\n\r\n* When Faraday first introduced the idea of the electric and magnetic fields, he was thinking in terms of :jargon:`field lines`. These are mathematically very similar the streamlines we talked about when studying fluid flow. (They may be conceptually similar also: in quantum field theory, the EM field is modeled as a flood of quantum photons.) \r\n\r\n* Each electric charges is either a source or sink of these electric field lines: positive charges are sources and negative charges are sinks. The field lines radiate from these charges and distribute themselves evenly throughout space. The density of the field lines represent the magnitude of the electric field at that point. \r\n\r\n* We call the :jargon:`electric flux` is the \"number\" of field lines running through any given surface. We have:\r\n\r\n  .. math::\r\n\r\n      \\Phi_\\text{ele} = \\sum \\avg{E}A \\cos \\theta \r\n      \r\n  where :math:`\\Phi` is the electric flux and :math:`\\avg{E} \\cos \\theta` is the average value of the electric field running perpendicular through the surface :math:`A`. \r\n  \r\n* :math:`Gauss' Law` states that the value of the electric flux through any closed surface is directly proportional to the amount of charge enclosed by the surface: \r\n\r\n  .. math::\r\n\r\n      \\sum \\Phi_\\text{ele} = Q_\\text{tot} / \\epsilon_0 \r\n      \r\n* This actually follows from Coulomb's law and that fact that the surface area of a sphere is :math:`4\\pi r^2`."

On the other side are :jargon:`insulators` which strongly resist the flow of electric charge. We can use conductors to transport charge and insulators to hold it. \r\n\r\n* Since charge flows easily in a conductor, any excess charge will be pushed to the surface and spread evenly througout. If we take another conductor and touch a charged one, the excess charge will spread to it also. In this way we can \"pick up\" the charge and move it.\r\n\r\n* There is a trickier way to \"induce\" charge in a conductor. Suppose we place a positively charged object close to a neutral conductor. This will pull the negative charge close and push the postive charge away. If we allow the postive charge to drain away, the conductor is left with a net negative charge.\r\n\r\n* One important configuration to consider is the :jargon:`capacitor`, which is simply two parallel conductive plates separated by an insulator. A capacitor \"traps\" electric charge: one plate with positive charge and the other with negative charge. These two sets of charge will attract, but the insulator keeps them apart.\r\n\r\n* The charge on each plate distributes itself: we end up with a consistent charge per unit area (symbol = :math:`\\sigma`).

The factor of one-half is there because the potential energy builds up with each incremental charge.
