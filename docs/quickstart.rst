Quick start
===========

1. Download a copy of the latest project and install the prerequisites (see ``requirements.txt``).
2. Sync and migrate the database (be sure to add a superuser).
3. Fire up the admin and add your first classroom.
4. Futz through the admin and add more stuff.
5. Surf to your new website! Note that you'll already be logged in since you were just in the admin. 
   You can log out to see what the site will look like to the public.
6. If you don't like the default look and feel, modify the various css files in ``website/static/website`` or 
   in the static folder of each app.

Hmm... piles of cash work fine. Patches are also welcome.
